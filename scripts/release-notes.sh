# version's section merged with anything still under [Unreleased]. A
# rebuild of an already-released version (changes pushed without a version
# bump) replaces its binaries, so its notes must cover those changes too.
# Only the newest version (or one with no section yet) takes them.
# Headings come out in Keep-a-Changelog order; newer ([Unreleased]) bullets
# first under each. Prints nothing if neither section has bullets.
